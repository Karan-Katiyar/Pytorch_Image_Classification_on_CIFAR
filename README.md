# Pytorch_Image_Classification_on_CIFAR

Convolutional Neural Network with ReLu activation function applied on CIFAR dataset to classify images while achieving 90.4% accuracy in 30 epochs

Accuracy can be improved via
   1) Improved training data augmentation
   2) Improved network design
   3) Improved network training

Examples (currently commented out) are included for the following
   1) Computing the dataset mean and std dev
   2) Checkpointing during training and restarting training after a crash

TO DO

    0. Quick test to validate performance after refactoring

    1. Update class name display so names do not need to be manually entered
